I have started this project as wifi Embded Internet radio on ESP32 WROOM and vs1053b 24bit. I would recommand KaRadio opensource library. I love how Russians are relegiously follow and experimenting their projects.


Later migrated the project to ESP32 WROVER for enhanced features.
Having 8 MB SPI PSRAM and ACC for adding more stream audio over https. There is no buffering of the audio.

I am currently working on TTGO TAudio WROVER.

As I kept learning I have added stream for video as well.
