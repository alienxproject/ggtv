I have started C++ project on WIFI Embded Internet radio on MCU ESP32 WROOM + DAC VS1053b 24bit I2S audio processor, 3 Band eq. I would recommand [KaRadio32](https://github.com/karawin/Ka-Radio32) opensource library. I love how the [community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/162949914181385) religiously follow and experiment their projects. 

Later migrated the project to ESP32 WROVER-B + PCM5102 32Bit I2S audio processor. Having 8 MB SPI PSRAM and AAC/OGG for adding more stream audio over the https. Now there is no buffering of the audio. 

I am porting the project in LilyGo [TTGO TAudio](http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=50063&Id=1171). MCU ESP32 WROVER-B + DAC WM8978 I2S 24Bit 5 band eq.

As I kept learning I have created this web app. Video streams are added along with internet radio streams. I have created this project for fun and learning purpose.
