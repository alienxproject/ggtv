Journey so far:<br>
I have developed a WIFI Internet radio prototype using Embedded C++.

Prototype v1: MCU ESP32 WROOM + 0.9 in OLED I2C Display + DAC VS1053b 24bit I2S audio processor, 3 Band eq. I would recommand [KaRadio32](https://github.com/karawin/Ka-Radio32) opensource library. I love how the [community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/162949914181385) religiously follow and experiment with their projects. 

Prototype v2: Due to the buffering of streams. I have migrated the project to ESP32 WROVER-B + 1.4 in OLED I2C Display  + PCM5102 32Bit I2S audio processor. Having 8 MB SPI PSRAM and AAC/OGG I  added more audio streams over the https. 

Prototype v3: I am porting the project in LilyGo [TTGO TAudio](http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=50063&Id=1171). MCU ESP32 WROVER-B + DAC WM8978 I2S 24Bit 5 band eq.

As I kept learning I have created this web app. Video streams are added along with internet radio streams. I have created this project for fun and learning purpose.
