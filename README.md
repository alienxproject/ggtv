I have started C++ project on WIFI Embded Internet radio on ESP32 WROOM and vs1053b 24bit I2S audio processor. I would recommand [KaRadio32](https://github.com/karawin/Ka-Radio32) opensource library. I learned that WebStations are listed in a seperate file. I love how community religiously follow and experiment their projects. 

Later migrated the project to ESP32 WROVER for enhanced features and PCM5102 32Bit I2S audio processor. Having 8 MB SPI PSRAM and AAC/OGG for adding more stream audio over the https. Now there is no buffering of the audio.

I am porting the project in TTGO TAudio.
As I kept learning I have added stream for video as well and created this iptv and internet radio project.
